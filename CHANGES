    CHANGE LOG
 
                o Fixed a bug in handling of WAIT_THREAD() that could result 
                  in that data was not read properly in SMP mode.
                o Added the option --no-smp to turn off SMP support and bind
                  process(s) to CPU #0 (Linux only).
                o Added HAS_GLIBC_CUSTOM_STREAMS_ to control the use of this GNU 
                  extensions in glibc. This became necessary since many uClibc 
                  distributions choose not to provide glibc custom stream support.
                  Turning this feature off disables the support for "rar inside rar"
                  if the encapsulating file is compressed and/or encrypted. 
    1.07        o First official release (with source)
    1.07 beta   o Built against unrarlib v4.0 beta 4
                o Added a sliding window to the IO buffer to allow for at least
                  some sort of backward read support.
                  The window is currently hardcoded to half the I/O buffer size
                  (4/2 = 2MiB) and for that reason the I/O buffer size had to be
                  increased from 2MiB to 4MiB.
                o Fixed permissions to now be handled by kernel instead
                o Added limited support for "rar inside rar".
                  Main archive or encapsulated RAR file must not be a volume
                  (i.e. must be monolithic).
                  Only one (1) level of depth is supported (--seek-depth > 0).
                  Extracted file can be of any shape or form except for password
                  protection which is currently not supported (inherits main
                  archive password).
                o Use of external unrar program no longer required.
                  Can still be choosen instead of internal routines using the
                  --unrar-path option.
                o Minor memory leak fixed when parsing folders inside archives.
                o Built against unrarlib v3.93
                o Added support for password protected archives
                  (raw read mode not yet supported).
                o Some stability issues corrected.
                o Fixed an off-by-one bug (!?) in date/time hour calculation.
                o Changed 'blocks' calculation as returned by stat()
                o Fixed some memory leaks in cache collision chain
    1.06 beta   o Replaced the "Unique RAR File Library" (by Christian Scheurer)
                  with the more complete "Unrar C++ Library" (by Alexander Roshal)
                  and some extensions to it.
                o Minor source code clean up. Still lots left to do.
    <1.06       o First draft version(s) only published at opentvix.org and
                  xtreamer.net (no source)
