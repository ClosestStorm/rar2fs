    CHANGE LOG

    1.07        o First official release (with source)
                o Built against unrarlib v4.0 beta 4
    1.07 beta   o Fixed permissions to now be properly handled by kernel
                o Added limited support for "rar inside rar".
                  Main archive or encapsulated RAR file must not be a volume
                  (i.e. must be monolithic).
                  Only one (1) level of depth is supported (--seek-depth > 0).
                  Extracted file can be of any shape or form except for password
                  protection which is currently not supported (inherits main
                  archive password).
                o Use of external unrar program no longer required.
                  Can still be choosen instead of internal routines using the
                  --unrar-path option.
                o Minor memory leak fixed when parsing folders inside archives.
                o Built against unrarlib v3.93
                o Added support for password protected archives
                  (raw read mode not yet supported).
                o Some stability issues corrected.
                o Fixed an off-by-one bug (!?) in date/time hour calculation.
                o Changed 'blocks' calculation as returned by stat()
                o Fixed some memory leaks in cache collision chain
    1.06 beta   o Replaced the "Unique RAR File Library" (by Christian Scheurer)
                  with the more complete "Unrar C++ Library" (by Alexander Roshal)
                  and some extensions to it.
                o Minor source code clean up. Still lots left to do.
    <1.06       o First draft version(s) only published at opentvix.org and
                  xtreamer.net (no source)
