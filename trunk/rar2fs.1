.SH NAME
.B rar2fs
\- FUSE file system for reading RAR archives
.SH SYNOPSIS
rar2fs [options] <root dir> <mount point>
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
rar2fs is a FUSE based file system that can mount a source directory containing any number of RAR archive files and access the contents of those as plain files (read only). Regular files/directories located in the source directory are handled transparently. Both compressed and non-compressed (store) archives/volumes are supported but full seek support in raw mode is only available for non-compressed archives.

.SH OPTIONS
Besides the standard FUSE options rar2fs accepts the follwing options that can be passed to the program.
.TP
.B --show-comp-img
show image files (.iso;.img;.nrg) also for compressed archives
.TP
.B --preopen-img
prefetch volume file descriptors for image files (.iso;.img;.nrg)
.TP
.B --fake-iso
fake .iso extension for .img/.nrg files
.TP
.B --seek-length=n
set number of volume files that are traversed in search for headers [0=All]
.br

Normally the RAR specific header(s) describing the files contained in a volume is located in the first volume file. Providing a value of 1 here should thus be sufficient to cover most cases. The default is 0, meaning that the complete set of volumes files are searched for headers.
The lower the value (starting from 1) the faster the display of folders containing a lot of RAR volumes (or volumes with a lot of files) will become since the number of open/search/close requests can be reduced. 
.TP
.B --seek-depth=n
set number of levels down RAR files are parsed inside main archive [0=0ff]
.br

Currently only a depth of one (1) is supported. Setting seek depth to anything greater than this has no effect.
.TP
.B --no-idx-mmap
use direct file I/O instead of mmap() for .r2i files
.TP
.B --exclude="<file1>[;<file2>...<fileN>]"
exclude file filter

When file access is requested and the file can not be found on the local file system all RAR archives in target folder are also searched for it. Not until that last operation fails the file is considered missing. On some platforms certain files (eg. .lock files) are always accessed but are usually never to expect within a RAR archive.
Specifying this option will treat the listed files differently. If not found on local file system they will 
.I never
be searched for in the local RAR archives. This dramatically decrease the folder load/display time during 'ls' like operations on such systems.
Each file in the list should be seperated by a semi-colon.

It is also possible to use this option in such a way that it instead points to a file that lists the actual exclude filter. This is done by specifying an absolute file path (starting with '/') instead of a semi-colon seperated list of file names. The file pointed to may contain more than one line but for each line files should be seperated by a semi-colon.
.TP
.B --unrar-path=<path>
path to external unrar binary (overide unrarlib)
.TP
.B --no-password
disable password file support

Since rar2fs is non-interactive, passwords that are to be used to decrypt encrypted archives should be stored in a file with the same name
as the main archive/volume file but with a 
.I .pwd
extension. Beware that a password must be stored in clear text format and is thus not protected in any way from unauhorized access. Specifying this option will disable the support for encrypted archives.
.TP
.B --no-smp
disable SMP support (bind to CPU #0)
