NAME
       rar2fs - FUSE file system for reading RAR archives

SYNOPSIS
       rar2fs [options] <root dir> <mount point>

DESCRIPTION
       rar2fs is a FUSE based file system that can mount a source directory containing any number of RAR ar-
       chive files and access the contents of those as plain files (read  only).  Regular  files/directories
       located in the source directory are handled transparently. Both compressed and non-compressed (store)
       archives/volumes are supported but full seek support in raw mode is only available for non-compressed
       archives.

OPTIONS
       Besides the standard FUSE options rar2fs accepts the follwing options that can be passed to the  pro-
       gram.

       --show-comp-img
              show image files (.iso;.img;.nrg) also for compressed archives

       --preopen-img
              prefetch volume file descriptors for image files (.iso;.img;.nrg)

       --fake-iso
              fake .iso extension for .img/.nrg files

       --seek-length=n
              set number of volume files that are traversed in search for headers [0=All]

              Normally  the  RAR specific header(s) describing the files contained in a volume is located in
              the first volume file. Providing a value of 1 here should thus be  sufficient  to  cover  most
              cases. The default is 0, meaning that the complete set of volumes files are searched for head-
              ers.  The lower the value (starting from 1) the faster the display of folders containing a lot
              of  RAR  volumes  (or  volumes  with  a  lot  of  files)  will  become  since  the  number  of
              open/search/close requests can be reduced.

       --seek-depth=n
              set number of levels down RAR files are parsed inside main archive [0=0ff]

              Currently only a depth of one (1) is supported. Setting seek depth to  anything  greater  than
              this has no effect.

       --no-idx-mmap
              use direct file I/O instead of mmap() for .r2i files

       --no-filter
              do not apply .lock file filter

              When  file  access is requested and the file can not be found on the local file system all RAR
              archives in target folder are also searched for it. Not until that fails the file  is  consid-
              ered  missing.  On  some  platforms  .lock  files are always accessed but are usually never to
              expect within a RAR archive.  Specifying this option will treat .lock  files  differently.  If
              not  found  on  local file system it will never be searched for in RAR archives. This dramati-
              cally decrease the folder load/display time during 'ls' like operations on such systems.


       --unrar-path=<path>
              path to external unrar binary (overide unrarlib)

       --no-password
              disable password file support

              Since rar2fs is non-interactive, passwords that are to be used to decrypt  encrypted  archives
              should  be stored in a file with the same name as the main archive/volume file but with a .pwd
              extension. Beware that a password must be stored in clear text format and  is  thus  not  pro-
              tected in any way from unauhorized access. Specifying this option will disable the support for
              encrypted archives.

       --no-smp
              disable SMP support (bind to CPU #0)
