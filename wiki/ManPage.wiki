NAME
       rar2fs - FUSE file system for reading RAR archives

SYNOPSIS
       rar2fs [options] <root dir> <mount point>

DESCRIPTION
       rar2fs  is  a FUSE based file system that can mount a source directory containing any number of RAR archive files and access the contents of those
       as plain files (read only). Regular files/directories located in the source directory are handled  transparently.  Both  compressed  and  non-com-
       pressed (store) archives/volumes are supported but full seek support in raw mode is only available for non-compressed archives.

OPTIONS
       Besides the standard FUSE options rar2fs accepts the follwing options that can be passed to the program.

       --show-comp-img
              show image files (.iso;.img;.nrg) also for compressed/encrypted archives

              Image media files in compressed/encrypted archives usually does not playback very well, if at all. This is because imaged  media,  such  as
              DVD  images,  is  implementing  a file access pattern that can not be fully supported by a partly buffered decoded data stream with limited
              history. For that reason the default is to not display these files (hide).

       --preopen-img
              prefetch volume file descriptors for image files (.iso;.img;.nrg)

              This option will force all volume files to be opened before playback is started. Specifying this option might help in some rare  situations
              to  overcome transient playback disturbances at switch of volume files when mounted across a lossy/slow network. Note that this option only
              affects playback of image file media read in raw mode (not compressed/encrypted).

       --fake-iso
              fake .iso extension for .img/.nrg files

              Some media players does not support diplay of image files other than those with a .iso extension. However, .img files are usually 100% com-
              patiable  with  .iso and so is .nrg files, even though the .nrg format specification says otherwise. For that reason playback of .nrg might
              fail. Specifying this option will remove the need for renaming files to .iso just to make them display properly. If playback works  or  not
              is all about the player software from here.

       --seek-length=n
              set number of volume files that are traversed in search for headers [0=All]

              Normally  the RAR specific header(s) describing the files contained in a volume is located in the first volume file. Providing a value of 1
              here should thus be sufficient to cover most cases. The default is 0, meaning that the complete set of volumes files are searched for head-
              ers.   The  lower  the  value (starting from 1) the faster the display of folders containing a lot of RAR volumes (or volumes with a lot of
              files) will become since the number of open/search/close requests can be reduced.

       --seek-depth=n
              set number of levels down RAR files are parsed inside main archive [0=0ff]

              Currently only a depth of one (1) is supported. Setting seek depth to anything greater than this has no effect.

       --no-idx-mmap
              use direct file I/O instead of mmap() for .r2i files

       --exclude="<file1>[;<file2>;...<fileN>;]"

       --exclude=<path>
              exclude file filter

              When file access is requested and the file can not be found on the local file system all RAR archives in target folder  are  also  searched
              for  it.  Not  until that last operation fails the file is considered missing. On some platforms certain files (eg. .lock files) are always
              accessed but are usually never to expect within a RAR archive.  Specifying this option will treat the  listed  files  differently.  If  not
              found  on  local  file system they will never be searched for in the local RAR archives. This dramatically decrease the folder load/display
              time during 'ls' like operations on such systems.  Each file in the list should be seperated by a semi-colon ';' character.

              It is also possible to use this option in such a way that it instead points to a file that lists the actual exclude filter. This is done by
              specifying  an absolute file path (starting with '/') instead of a semi-colon seperated list of file names. The file pointed to may contain
              more than one line but for each line files should be seperated by a semi-colon ';' character.

       --unrar-path=<path>
              path to external unrar binary (overide unrarlib)

       --no-password
              disable password file support

              Since rar2fs is non-interactive, passwords that are to be used to decrypt encrypted archives should be stored in a file with the same  name
              as  the main archive/volume file but with a .pwd extension. Beware that a password must be stored in clear text format and is thus not pro-
              tected in any way from unauhorized access. Specifying this option will disable the support for encrypted archives.

       --no-smp
              disable SMP support (bind to CPU #0)
